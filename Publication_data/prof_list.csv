Felipe Andres,Aburto Guerrero,Assistant Professor,"In my research, I explore landscape-scale processes, human-soil interactions, and biogeochemical controls on soil mineral weathering, elemental cycling, and soil development. I emphasize pedological mechanisms and soil functions that support vital ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, nutrient and water cycling, and interactions among soils, microbes, vegetation, and hydrology at different scales.<br /><br />In my research program, I study the underpinning pedological mechanisms that control soil formation, like mineral weathering and secondary mineral formation and biogeochemical supporting processes that define ecosystem productivity and resilience. I believe an enhanced understanding of these mechanisms in natural and managed environments will allow the prediction of temporal, horizontal, and vertical distribution and changes of soil properties and functions and derived services at the landscape scale.<br /><br />In my previous research, I looked at soil development and weathering patterns in different environmental settings using traditional chronosequences and climosequences approaches. I also studied the effect of human disturbances, including agriculture and forest use intensification, grazing, fire, erosion, etc., on intrinsic soil properties linked to soil functions. I also direct and collaborate in applied research projects that look at the rate and state of recovery of inherent soil properties (e.g., mineralogy), microbial and fauna diversity, and C and nutrient cycling after restoration or reforestation with native vegetation.",Assistant Professor,Soil and Crop Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n1e3c38dc

Rodolfo,Aramayo,Associate Professor,"Dr. Aramayo's laboratory is centered on understanding the function(s) of RNAs, especially non-coding RNAs in all aspects of Biology. While the initial work was based on studying Meiotic Silencing in Neurospora, it became immediately clear that the RNA silencing mechanism invoked by this very unusual genetic phenomenon had been adapted and evolved to fulfill key highly-related roles in all eukaryotic cells. The complexity of the problem demanded the use of the most sophisticated molecular tools, especially Next Generation DNA Sequencing and the manipulation of the emerging information. In the process of mastering these computational tools and techniques, the Aramayo lab branched into studying the Computational Genomics aspect of these problems. The expertise thus generated could clearly be applied to all organisms and/or other systems. The Aramayo laboratory thus established active collaborations with researchers studying the biology of RNAs in Neurobiology, Muscular Distrophy and Cell Cycle. The computational expertise of this laboratory has also generated an active collaboration with Materials Sciences. The wet-lab aspect of this laboratory is still centered on understanding Meiotic Silencing, one of the most amazing and intriguing mechanisms observed in meiotic cells of eukaryotic organisms.

Aref,Arzan Zarin,Assistant Professor,"We are at the beginning of an exciting new era for neuroscience, as our ability to probe neural circuits and their neuronal components is advancing rapidly due to genetic and optogenetic tools. Our research program applies these tools to address fundamental questions about how the same neural circuitry generates different motor patterns, and how such circuits develop and are maintained. We investigate these questions using the Drosophila larva, which has the following advantages:(i) The connectome of the larval motor circuit is near completion, enabling us to identify, at the single-synapse level, the pre and postsynaptic partners of each individual neuron embedded in it. This anatomical map has provided an excellent substrate to study the development, maintenance, and function of larval motor circuits as well as the cell biology of individual neurons embedded within it. (ii) The larval CNS generates multiple motor behaviors that can be studied at the single neuron/single muscle level. Moreover, using the modern optogenetic methods, it is possible to access individual neurons, monitor or alter their activity, and observe the behavioral consequences. (iii) It is also feasible to selectively inactivate or induce ectopic expression of any gene (e.g. those coding for transcription factors) in the neuron of interest, and examine its effect on intrinsic neural properties, morphology, connectivity pattern, and behavioral performance of the animal, thereby linking the gene to development and behavior.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na0cb5dc6

Current research in my lab is focused on the study of reproductive and developmental toxicity of CrVI. Drinking water contamination with CrVI in the United States is a growing problem due to increased usage of CrVI and improper disposal of Cr waste into the environment. Significant contamination with CrVI has been found in the drinking water sources of all the states in the U.S. Effects of Cr on reproductive health in women and development in children have received less attention. Epidemiological data document that women exposed to Cr in environmental or occupational settings suffer from infertility, gynecological problems, congenital malformation of fetuses, neonatal mortality, and premature abortions with increased levels of Cr in their blood, urine and placenta. Cr can bind directly to DNA and nuclear proteins, cause DNA strand breaks and mutations, alter the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, and activate several cell signaling pathways. Therefore, my current research objective is to determine molecular pathways and identify target genes/proteins by which Cr alters prenatal development and organogenesis of female reproductive system in the offspring.",Assistant Professor,Veterinary Integrative Biosciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4783d1f1

Deborah,Bell-Pedersen,Professor,"My lab studies how the circadian clock functions to regulate daily rhythms in gene expression that lead to rhythms in physiology and behavior. Defects of the human clock are associated with several disorders, including sleep and metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. In addition, daily changes in metabolism influence the efficacy and toxicity of many pharmaceuticals, including cancer drugs. Therefore, knowing how clocks work and what the clock regulates at the molecular level is important for the development of new ways to improve human health. While most studies on the regulation of rhythmic gene expression have focused on clock control of transcription, we know that up to half of proteins that accumulate in eukaryotic cells with a circadian rhythm arise from mRNAs that do not cycle in abundance. These data suggested that the clock regulates protein turnover and/or mRNA translation; however, the mechanisms for this regulation were unknown. Using the model organism Neurospora crassa we discovered that the clock controls key conserved regulators of mRNA translation. In addition, we made the surprising discovery that the clock regulates the composition of ribosomes. Current projects, that are funded by the NIH,  include using genomic, genetic and molecular approaches to understand the mechanisms and impact of clock control of translation on rhythmic protein synthesis, and to uncover the connections between rhythmic protein production and the control of cell growth and metabolism by the clock",Professor and Associate Department Head,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n2a2bfb97

David,Bergbreiter,Professor,"Our group explores new chemistry related to catalysis and polymer functionalization using the tools and precepts of synthetic organic chemistry to prepare functional oligomers or polymers that in turn are used to either effect catalysis in a greener, more environmentally benign way or to more efficiently functionalize polymers. Often this involves creatively combining the physiochemical properties of a polymer with the reactivity of a low molecular weight compound to form new materials with new functions. These green chemistry projects involve undamental research both in synthesis and catalysis but has practical aspects because of its relevance to practical problems.<br /><br /><br /><br />A common theme in our catalysis studies is exploring how soluble polymers can facilitate homogeneous catalysis. Homogeneous catalysts are ubiquitously used to prepare polymers, chemical intermediates, basic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Such catalysts often use expensive or precious metals or expensive ligands or are used at relatively high catalyst loadings. The products often contain traces of these catalysts or ligands - traces that are undesirable for esthetic reasons or because of the potential toxicity of these impurities. Both the cost of these catalysts of these issues require catalyst/product separation - separations that often are inefficient and lead to chemical waste. These processes also use volatile organic solvents - solvents that have to be recovered and separated. Projects underway in our lab explore how soluble polymers can address each of these problems. Examples of past schemes that achieve this goal in a general way as highlighted in the Figure below.<br /><br /><br /><br />We also use functional polymers to modify existing polymers. Ongoing projects involve molecular design of additives that can more efficiently modify polymers' physical properties.

I often work at the nexus of typically disparate fields of study, for example combining genetic, phylogenetic, physiological and macroecological perspectives in a single analysis of distribution and dispersal (Bernardo et al. 2007).  Because multiple causality is inherent in understanding ecological and evolutionary problems, my research emphasizes a strong inference approach that therefore relies on both large datasets and multivariate statistical models to evaluate competing hypotheses.  Most of my active work involves vertebrates and insects and other major invertebrate groups.<br /><br /><br /><br />General areas of interest include: o determinants of range size and position o biodiversity conservation in the face of climate change o detection, and ecological and conservation implications of cryptic speciation and diversity o vertebrate ecology and life history o biology of amphibians and reptiles, especially salamanders and lizards o speciation and evolution of reproductive isolation o evolutionary ecology of body size including its role in species packing and community assembly o clinal variation in life history and physiological traits o comparative animal physiology and physiological ecology especially as they relate to life history variation and range occupation (macrophysiology) o life history evolution o evolution and implications of maternal effects, especially propagule size o experimental ecology",Research Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5787076f

Janet,Bluemel,Professor,"Major research interests in my group include (1) immobilized catalysts, (2) the surface chemistry of oxide materials and (3) solid-state NMR spectroscopy.<br /><br /><br /><br />Immobilized catalysts (1) allow the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts to be combined with those of homogeneous catalysts. In particular, surface-immobilized homogeneous catalysts are easy to recycle, and can be highly active and selective. Furthermore they are amenable to systematic design. We find the most interesting results when heterobimetallic systems, such as the Sonogashira Pd/Cu catalyst for the coupling of aryl halides and terminal alkynes, are involved. Effective immobilization requires a thorough understanding of the surface chemistry of the oxide support materials (2). Therefore, we investigate not only the reactivity of metal complexes and linkers, but also their mobility on the surfaces. <br /><br /><br /><br />The most powerful analytical tool for investigating amorphous materials is solid-state NMR spectroscopy (3). We optimized this method especially for surface-bound species, enabling us to study reactions on surfaces, or analyze the nature of our anchored linkers and catalysts.<br /><br /><br /><br />These different research areas provide my students with a strong multidisciplinary background, spanning from synthetic chemistry, through materials sciences and catalysis, to surface analytical methods including solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

Kevin,Burgess,Professor,"We use novel strategies Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) that feature datamining to compare simulated preferred conformers of chemotypes we design with key features at protein-protein interfaces. Many chemotype candidates can be screened against one PPI, or one chemotype can be screened against all the PPI interfaces in the PDB. Virtual hit chemotypes are prepared in my lab, then tested against protein-protein interactions of biomedicinal interest using an array of biophysical and cellular assays.<br /><br />We also design small molecules to target cell surface receptors that are selectively overexpressed in cancer cells. Much or our work has been focused on the TrkC receptor that is particularly important to metastatic breast cancer and melanoma. Going forwards we are interested in expanding the targets to include cell surface receptors that are overexpressed when cancer cells undergo aberrant epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) to produce circulating tumor cells and cancer stem cells.

Abraham,Clearfield,Distinguished Professor,"Our research interests are focused in solid state and materials chemistry and encompass a wide variety of projects. An important goal is the ability to design and synthesize new materials whose structure and properties can be predicted and controlled. Layered compounds are amenable to manipulation to produce new structures because of the weak forces between layers. We have learned how to separate the layers of several classes of compounds and are reconstituting them into novel materials. For example, we have prepared staged materials in which alternating layers are hydrophobic and hydrophilic.<br /><br /><br /><br />The surfaces of our layered materials react with a variety of molecules to bond them to the surface. We are developing such materials for drug delivery, heterogeneous catalysis, and polymer-nanoparticle composites.<br /><br /><br /><br />Single crystal X-ray diffraction has been the key tool in elucidating the structure of solids. For many compounds, single crystals are unavailable so that indirect methods need to be used. We pioneered the solution of crystal structures from X-ray powder data and have had considerable success. The methods need to be improved and extended to more complex systems such as poorly crystallized materials. Combined use of X-ray, neutron and synchrotron methods are in progress and extension to EXAFS and amorphous scattering techniques is contemplated.",Distinguished Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n6dc4bd81

Teleost fishes are without-a-doubt the most successful group of fishes (and probably vertebrates) on the planet currently and have colonized almost all available aquatic habitats (and even some terrestrial habitats). The morphological diversity of teleosts is unparalleled by any other group of vertebrates, ranging in size from tiny 7mm long minnows to 10meter long oar fish, and in shape from ribbon-like eels to globe-like pufferfishes.  We investigate this diversity not only to further our understanding of vertebrate anatomy in general but also to discover novel characters to advance our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of select groups of teleost fishes. Our investigations frequently lead to the discovery of previously unrecognized taxonomic diversity and one of the broader aims of the TAMU Systematic Ichthyology Laboratory is to document this diversity through the description of new species.",Associate Professor,Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfaafc469

Nathan,Crick,Professor,"Dr. Crick's work explores the relationship between and power throughout different periods of political and social change, focusing specifically on those factors which are result of conscious strategies of persuasion by individuals or groups. This goal requires research into a variety of diverse topics, roughly including classical rhetorical theory, social media, the structure of news, religious rhetoric, modern propaganda, the rhetoric of science and technology, the power of aesthetics, the dynamics of social movements, and the history of philosophy. His first book, Democracy and Rhetoric: John Dewey on the Arts of Becoming, uses Dewey's philosophy to construct a view of rhetoric, logic, and aesthetics that is consistent with an ethics of democracy that promotes creative individuality. His second book, Rhetoric and Power: The Drama of Classical Greece, explores through the texts of canonical authors like Aeschylus, Gorgias, Thucydides, and Plato how rhetoric was conceptualized as a means of constituting and transforming power in Greek political culture. His third book, The Keys of Power: The Rhetoric and Politics of Transcendentalism, interprets the writing and thought of figures like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller as active rhetorical engagements with the political controversies of their time. His fourth book, Dewey for a New Age of Fascism: Teaching Democratic Habits, I use Dewey's late writing to offer a critique of fascist anti-humanism and to contrast it with his ideal of democratic humanism and the arts of rhetoric, logic, and aesthetics that provide their foundation.",Professor,Communication,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n8a3cbb63

Charles,Criscione,Professor,"I examine fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions in parasite systems and consider my research to be at the interface of ecology, evolution, and genetics.  Parasitology provides a rich subject area for studies of ecology and evolutionary biology.  Numerous topics such as ecosystem dynamics, mating systems, or coevolution can be addressed because parasites are extremely diverse.  By diversity, I include not only the myriad of taxa that have independently evolved a parasitic lifestyle, but also the diversity in life cycles, modes of reproduction, host species, and ecosystems utilized by parasites.  This diversity also allows for comparative studies to address theories or unifying principles that span ecosystems or taxonomic groups.  Furthermore, there are many practical applications such as studying the evolution of drug resistance, or using parasite community structure to assess ""ecosystem health"".  My research interests address both basic and applied questions, and span three overlapping subject areas: 1) Evolution: Population Genetics, Mating Systems, and Molecular Epidemiology, 2) Ecology: Biodiversity, Conservation, and Natural History, and 3) Genetics and Ecological Genomics.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n41a8b584

In our research program we have attempted to establish a clearer mechanistic view of carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-oxygen bond forming processes resulting from carbon dioxide insertion into M-H, M-C, and M-O bonds.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant to the latter process our research has addressed the utilization of carbon dioxide in the development of improved synthetic routes for the production of polycarbonates. The hazardous and expensive production process currently in place industrially for these materials involves the interfacial polycondensation of phosgene and diols, accentuates the need for these studies. Although we and others have made significant advances in the synthesis of these useful thermoplastics from carbon dioxide and epoxides much of the fundamental knowledge concerning the reaction kinetics of these processes is lacking, due in part to the practical challenges associated with sampling and analyzing systems at elevated temperatures and pressures. This information is needed for making this process applicable to the synthesis of a variety of copolymers possessing a range of properties and uses. Our studies are examining in detail the mechanistic aspects of metal catalyzed carbon dioxide/epoxide coupling reactions employing in situ spectroscopy methods. For this purpose Fourier-transform infrared attenuated total refluctance (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy is being utilized.

Sumana,Datta,Assistant Provost,"We are currently investigating how organismal level cues regulate the onset of stem cell division during development. Our primary system is the neuroblasts in the brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The trol gene of Drosophila encodes the fly homolog of the mammalian heparan sulfate glycoprotein, Perlecan. Perlecan is found in mice, humans, and C. elegans, and is widely known as a co-receptor for the growth factor FGF. We have shown that Trol, the Drosophila Perlecan homolog, is required for signaling by FGF. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Trol is also a likely candidate for the Hedgehog co-receptor. Hedgehogs are peptide growth factors which are conserved in mammals and require heparan sulfate glycoproteins for their movement and long-range signaling; however, until now the identity of the protein core was unknown. Our studies demonstrate genetic interactions between trol and hedgehog or patched mutations (patched is the Hedgehog receptor). Further studies reveal that both FGF and Hedgehog signaling activate stem cell division.

Timothy,Devarenne,Associate Professor,"We study the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the control of programmed cell death (PCD) in plants and how PCD is manipulated during plant-pathogen interactions. Specifically we study the interaction between tomato and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) the causative agent of bacterial spot disease. Resistance to this disease is conferred by the host Pto serine/threonine protein kinase which recognizes Pst strains expressing the type III effector protein AvrPto.<br /><br />PCD is induced during both resistant and susceptible plant-pathogen interactions. In the case of a resistant interaction, PCD induced by the plant, known as the hypersensitive response (HR), and acts to limit the spread of the pathogen. In susceptible plant-pathogen interactions plant PCD is induced by the pathogen after infection leading to death of the host. Studies have indicated that the genes controlling host PCD during the HR are the same genes that are manipulated by the pathogen during susceptible interactions. The difference lies in the timing of controlling the activity of these genes; HR PCD occurs within 12 hours of pathogen recognition while pathogen-induced PCD occurs several days after infection.<br /><br /><br /><br />Many of these genes that control plant PCD are serine/threonine (S/T) protein kinase. We are interested in studying a specific class of S/T protein kinases that control PCD in plants called AGC kinases and how they are regulated in both resistant and susceptible plant-pathogen interactions. Additionally, when plants are not attacked by pathogens, PCD is a process that requires constant control so that cell death does not occur. We are looking at the signaling mechanisms and pathways employed to keep PCD under check in non-pathogen challenged plants.",Faculty Affiliate||Associate Professor,Energy Institute||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n11411275

Since the capacity of sport to deliver socially valued outcomes (e.g., health, well-being, sense of community, economic development) depends on the nature of sport program content and delivery, my work endeavors to identify how sport can be designed, managed, and marketed to promote and enhance the life quality of individuals, families, and communities.

Normatively, these findings also bear implications for modification of sport programs and systems.  Thus, my work has two goals:  (1) to formulate a model that describes and explains relations between the characteristics of sport programs and systems and their consequent effects on the lives of those who provide or who do sport, and (2) to thereby enable formulation, management, and marketing of sport programs that consistently and effectively add value to the lives of individuals, families, the communities in which they live.",Professor,Health and Kinesiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n0cbb0886

Sharon,Dormire,Professor,"The overall focus of my program of research is reproductive health promotion for women. Specifically, my work explores menopausal hot flashes as a result of estrogen related changes in brain glucose metabolism. Although menopausal hot flashes (HF) have long been assumed to be benign, albeit uncomfortable, emerging evidence links higher rates of HF with both cognitive decline and cardiac disease. Understanding these associations is challenging because the physiology of the HF, is not well described.  It is commonly believed that either endocrine or thermoregulatory events in the hypothalamus are the trigger.  However, emerging evidence indicates that HF are complex and multi-causal reflecting a combination of endocrine, genetic, cultural, dietary, physical and individual factors. Building on studies of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, we propose impaired glucose deliver hypothesis. Mediated by estradiol, neuronal activation stimulates neurobarrier coupling increasing production of glucose transporter 1 and causing vasodilation. These changes are examined as the basis of the HF ultimately leading to cognitive change at menopause. Next steps in this work are to identify reliable methods to induce HF in symptomatic women and image using PET technology the bioenergetics of glucose transport and metabolism both during the HF and without it.",Associate Dean for Undergraduate Nursing Education||Professor,College of Nursing||College of Nursing,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nd08ea40b

Fungal effectors play roles in suppressing host defense mechanisms, however, other biotrophic functions, such as manipulating host physiology to promote nutrient acquisition and cell-to-cell movement are possible.  Therefore, identification of the full set of fungal proteins secreted during host invasion is a major effort in plant pathology research.  Candidate effectors are generally identified by virtue of i) their expression in planta ii) assessing their activity on the host using purified proteins or by manipulating expression iii) detecting the rapid evolution of effector genes due to selective pressure from the host.

Key to this work is elucidating how children's self-regulation and social cognitions influence the associations between children's social experiences and their behavioral adjustment. His research applies a variety of longitudinal and developmental methodologies (e.g., structural equation modeling, latent growth modeling, latent transition analysis, mediation analysis, missing data analysis).

Sherecce,Fields,Associate Professor,"My research focuses on the trans-disease processes of cognitive and emotional dysregulation and how these factors affect health-risk behaviors in adolescents. Identifying trans-disease processes that contribute to the development or maintenance of multiple diagnostic categories -- that underlie both substance use and obesity -- can enhance the development of interventions that target the underlying process rather than specific symptoms of a single disorder. This not only provides a more efficient approach to treatment, it is particularly relevant to health disparities. I am especially interested in how these trans-disease processes interact with family, social, and psychological factors to increase engagement in health-related risk behaviors, and the development of appropriate prevention and intervention tools that can be used to improve health outcomes in youth. I conceptualize these processes in the context of physical and mental health disparities as they relate to stress, minority status (race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender) and socioeconomic factors (food insecurity).",Faculty Fellow||Associate Department Head||Faculty Affiliate||Associate Professor,Center for Health Systems and Design||Psychological and Brain Sciences||Psychological and Brain Sciences||Institute for Engineering Education and Innovation,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n9f216306

Mark,Fossett,Professor,"My research explores the intersection of social and spatial demography and racial and ethnic inequality and stratification.  Much of my work examines the conceptualization and measurement of intergroup inequality and seeks to understand how it varies across time and across communities.  Relatedly, I have studied how community characteristics like relative minority size affect racial and ethnic prejudice and racial and ethnic socioeconomic inequality.  I also have focused on the question of how imbalances in the number of men and women in communities affects family formation and the fraction of children being reared in mother-father families.  In recent years I have examined the conception and measurement of residential segregation and formulated a new measurement framework.  This new approach makes it possible to unify research on micro-level processes of residential attainment and city-level outcomes for residential segregation.  It also makes it possible to measure segregation free of the vexing problem of index bias.  Finally, understandings rooted in the new framework clarify how to best measure group residential separation noting that the dissimilarity index - the mostly widely used measure - is flawed and unreliable for assessing this aspect of residential segregation.  I also have pioneered using computational models to investigate residential segregation dynamics.  Agent translate discursive theories of segregation into concrete representations that then can be used to explore the implications of theory via judicious model-based experimentation.  Most segregation research involves analysis of observational data at the aggregate level. This is poorly suited for untangling the complex effects that produce patterns of racial and ethnic segregation in urban areas. I have shown how computational models provide a potentially useful option for investigating how complex micro-level dynamics produce group differences in residential distributions across urban areas.",Professor,Sociology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3ba5e68e

Dana,Gaddy,Professor,"My laboratory has been engaged in multiple areas of NIH-funded musculoskeletal research since 1996. We were the first to identify the non-steroidal gonadal inhibin hormones in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-skeletal axis in mice, and the role of changes in inhibins that signal the onset of menopause (reproductive aging) to the onset of increasing bone turnover. We also demonstrated the anabolic effect of continual Inhibin exposure in normal mice and in bone repair.  Our cellular focus on Inhibins and the related factor, Activin A revealed that Activin A suppresses local bone resorption through suppression of osteoclast formation, motility and survival. Our ongoing work is in the area of specific inhibin/betaglycan receptor interactions that mediate the effects on bone cells. We are also greatly interested in improving the low bone mass that we were the first to identify in both humans with Down Syndrome (DS) and in mouse models of DS as a low bone turnover disease. Our current NIH-funded research is working to identify the mechanisms of reduced fracture healing and compromised bone regeneration in Down Syndrome. We have demonstrated the efficacy of both PTH and SclAb in DS, and are now actively testing nutriceuticals to increase bone mass in mouse models of Down Syndrome. The limitations of using mouse models to study bone disease led us to our most recent and exciting endeavors in collaboration with TAMU experts in reproduction and embryo transfer technologies to develop a large platform model of bone disease, using sheep. We have generated the first large animal model of hypophosphatasia (HPP) via high efficiency gene editing of a knock-in point mutation in the ALPL gene, whose musculoskeletal and dental phenotypes are consistent with human HPP. We are now using this model to determine the etiology of mineralization deficiencies, muscle weakness and premature tooth loss by analysis of longitudinal biopsies and analysis of muscle, bone and dental specimens using CT, microCT, mechanical testing, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry and ex vivo bone marrow cultures.",Professor||Adjunct Professor,Veterinary Integrative Biosciences||Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n2dc10a1a

Luis,Garcia,Professor,"I am interested in understanding how behavioral states are regulated at the molecular and genetic level. My lab addresses this complex question in the well-studied nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Several physical aspects of this worm make it convenient for integrating whole organism system biology studies with genetic/molecular analysis of neurobiology and behavior. C. elegans is an anatomically simple organism; it is 1mm in size, and it contains ~ 1000 somatic cells, a third of which are neurons. The worm is also transparent, and thus every cell can be visualized by light microscopy. Behavioral mutants can be efficiently generated through standard chemical mutagenesis. In addition, gene functions involved in motivational and behavioral regulation can be determined by transgenic techniques.<br /><br /><br /><br />My lab investigates the interplay between feeding and sex-specific mating behavior to understand how chemo/mechano-sensory and motor outputs are controlled under various physiological conditions. We study male mating by using genetics to de-construct this behavior into its fundamental sensory-motor components. We then use a combination of transgenics, pharmacology, classical genetics and laser microsurgery to understand how individual motor sub-behaviors are coordinated to produce gross behaviors during periods when the animal is food deprived, and when it is food satiated.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4cd2f794

Cedric,Geoffroy,Assistant Professor,"The main focus of the laboratory is to better understand the molecular, cellular and physiological changes occurring after neurotrauma, in particular after spinal cord injury (SCI). Indeed, SCI is the second cause of paralysis, following close behind stroke. But besides the direct locomotor impairments, SCI also leads to numerous health complications, including metabolic syndrome, respiratory and cardiovascular problems. These health complications not only threaten patients' lives, but also impact their quality of life. Therefore, one major aim in my lab is to better understand the physiopathology of the SCI and health complications occurring after chronic SCI (in mouse models of SCI). Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we aim at finding targets that can reduce incidence of these health issues as well as reverse them in more chronic models.<br /><br /><br /><br />The second goal of my lab is to understand how age impacts SCI. Indeed, SCI increasingly afflicts the middle-aged population, as a result of both later average incidence (from ~29 in the 1970s to ~42 since 2010) and aging of SCI-paralyzed patients (~75% of people with SCI are over 40 years old). Recently, we demonstrated that axon regeneration is impaired after injury in older animals. This decline in axon growth can be controlled by both neuronal intrinsic and extrinsic factors. By better understanding the players involved in this age-dependent growth decline, we aim at finding targets to promote axon growth after SCI and ultimately promote locomotor function recovery in the middle-aged population.",Assistant Professor,Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne49dfc75

How do new metabolic pathways evolve? Are there multiple evolutionary pathways to evolve new enzyme activities?<br /><br /><br /><br />Our primary focus is on how catalytic promiscuity serves as the raw material for evolving new enzyme activities. Catalytic promiscuity is the ability to catalyze different chemical reactions using the same active site. Many enzymes in one branch of the protein family we are studying are catalytically promiscuous, and this activity has been incorporated into new metabolic pathways more than once. Comparing the sequences and structures of these proteins will identify characteristics that permitted them to evolve the second activity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our goal is to use results from our research to identify fundamental evolutionary principles that can can help decipher protein structure-function relationships, predict protein functions, and improve protein engineering methods.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n721200c3

Vishal,Gohil,Associate Professor,"Despite the fundamental role of the mitochondrion in cellular energy production and its involvement in numerous human diseases, we still do not know the function of nearly 20% of the known mitochondrial proteins. My laboratory applies genomic, genetic, and biochemical tools to uncover the role of these uncharacterized proteins in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) biogenesis. MRC is the main site of cellular respiration and energy production and since the core components of the MRC are evolutionarily conserved, we reason that the assembly factors required to build the MRC should also be conserved. Therefore, we utilize multiple models systems, including yeast, zebrafish, and human cell lines, to determine the role of these conserved, uncharacterized mitochondrial proteins in bioenergetics, organismal development, and human disease pathogenesis.<br /><br /><br /><br />Another poorly understood aspect of the mitochondrial energy metabolism is the role of phospholipids in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the MRC. Although it is well known that the MRC is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, how the unique lipid milieu of the mitochondrial membrane influences the assembly and activity of the MRC is not fully understood. We have constructed yeast mutants with defined mitochondrial phospholipid compositions to systematically determine each lipid's role in MRC assembly and activity. Ultimately, defining the roles of mitochondrial proteins and phospholipids will allow us to develop better diagnostic and therapeutic options for human disorders resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction.",Faculty Affiliate||Assistant Professor,Energy Institute||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n03100e49

Richard,Gomer,Professor,"Our laboratory is working on three areas of biomedicine, trying to move observations from basic research into the clinic. First, we are studying how the sizes of tissues and tumors are regulated, and how this can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes. As a model system, we are using the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, which allows us to combine techniques such as biochemistry, genetics, computer modeling, and cell biology to study tissue size regulation. We have found that a secreted protein as well as the unusual molecule polyphosphate are signals in negative feedback loops that inhibit Dictyostelium cell proliferation, and we are studying the signal transduction pathway to understand similar mechanisms in humans.<br /><br /><br /><br />Second, we are studying how some secreted proteins can make cells move away from the source of the signal. We found such a signal (called a chemorepellent) in Dictyostelium, and then found a similar signal in humans. We are working to understand the signal transduction pathway for both. The human signal repels neutrophils, and we found that this can be used therapeutically in mouse models of neutrophil-driven diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br /><br /><br /><br />Third, we have found that a human blood protein called Serum Amyloid P (SAP) regulates a key step in the formation of scar tissue as well as the formation of the scar-like lesions in fibrosing diseases such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary fibrosis. We are studying this mechanism, and a biotech company (Promedior) we co-founded is testing SAP as a therapy for fibrosis in patients in two Phase 2 trials.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf41f3898

In interphase, the actinomyosin network drives movement of the ER, just as it drives the movement organelles through the cytoplasm in a process called cytoplasmic streaming, a phenomenon in plants, but not animal cells.  Of the seventeen different myosin forms in plants, only six are involved in active cytoplasmic streaming. We are sorting out which of those six guide the different movements of the endoplasmic reticulum.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am also interested in the nature of the nexus between the ER and other organelles, including the chloroplast, plasma membrane, and Golgi.

Paul,Hardin,Distinguished Professor,"A diverse array of organisms including prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, plants, and animals display daily rhythms in physiology, metabolism and/or behavior. These rhythms are not passively driven by environmental cycles of light and temperature, but are actively controlled by endogenous circadian clocks that are set by environmental cycles, keep time in the absence of environmental cues, and activate overt physiological, metabolic and behavioral rhythms at the appropriate time of day. This remarkable conservation of circadian clock function through evolution suggests that maintaining synchrony with the environment is of fundamental importance. Our understanding of the circadian clock is particularly important for human health and well-being. The clearest examples of circadian clock dysfunction are those that result in abnormal sleep-wake cycles, but clock disturbances are also associated with other ailments including epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, depression, and seasonal affective disorder. The realization that disorders of the sleep-wake cycle such as Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome can result from alterations in clock gene function underscores the clinical importance of understanding the molecular organization of the circadian system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Work in my laboratory focuses on defining the molecular mechanisms that drive circadian clock function in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We previously found that the core timekeeping mechanism is based on core and interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. Our studies currently focus on (1) defining post-translational regulatory mechanisms that operate in the core loop to set the 24 hour period, (2) determining whether interlocked loops are important for circadian timekeeping and/or output, (3) understanding how circadian oscillator cells are determined during development, and (4) defining mechanisms that control rhythms in olfactory and gustatory physiology and behavior.",Distinguished Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf27056c4

Travis,Hein,Professor,"My laboratory studies the regulation of microvascular function at the level of arterioles in the retinal and coronary circulations. Sufficient blood flow supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues to maintain normal function is controlled in large part by changes in the diameter of arterioles. Vasoconstriction or vasodilation of these small arteries will decrease or increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to the tissue, respectively. Two key chemical factors that are produced within the endothelial cells of blood vessels to control their diameter are nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator, and endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictor. An imbalance in the production and/or release of these vasoactive factors has been implicated in the early stages of several cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms contributing to these pathophysiological changes remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, our research focuses on identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the vasomotor responses of arterioles to NO and endothelin-1 under conditions of health and disease. Current approaches that we use to investigate these mechanisms in the microcirculation include isolated and perfused arterioles, cultured vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, biochemical and molecular techniques (for detection of NO, superoxide anion, protein, and mRNA in arterioles), pharmacological and silencing RNA (siRNA) treatments, and blood flow velocity assessment via Doppler ultrasound.",Professor,Medical Physiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n45051e1b

John,Hettema,Professor,"I am Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Texas A&M Health Sciences Center and affiliate faculty member at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). As a clinician-scientist, I have participate in patient care, clinical teaching, and research activities. Before coming to TAMU in 2019, I directed the VCU Anxiety Disorders Specialty Clinic for 19 years, providing residency training and patient care via the assessment and treatment of all the major anxiety and related disorders. My research efforts focus on the epidemiology, genetics, and biology of the anxiety and related internalizing disorders. I have extensive experience applying advanced statistical genetic methodology to these questions via analyses conducted in twin, family, and population-based samples. My recent projects include conducting meta-analyses of genomewide association data on anxiety spectrum disorders (ANGST GWAS project, R01MH087646 and PGC-ANX project, R01MH113665), examining the effects of novel candidate genes derived from GWAS on internalizing psychopathology (R01MH039096), and collecting and analyzing endophenotypic measures underlying the development of internalizing disorders in a juvenile twin sample (R01MH098055). My research has been funded by NIH and private foundation grants.

In particular, I am interested in identifying (a) the ways in which cortical pathways for language processing are influenced by systematic differences in early language experience (e.g., bilingualism) and (b) how these pathway differences relate to executive functions over the lifespan (e.g., the robustness of working memory).  Health-related effects of cognitive decline cost the health care system millions of dollars each year, but new research suggests that certain kinds of bilingualism may defend the brain from age-related cognitive losses.  However, very little is known about the neural substrates that may underlie this defense.  The rationale of my research program is that identification of the neural mechanisms associated with different language histories will lay the groundwork for investigating precisely whether and how bilingualism is uniquely associated with a reduction in age-related cognitive decline.",Lecturer,Psychological and Brain Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n225e1e9d

Robert,Hutchison,Associate Professor,"I am an Associate Professor at Texas A&M University College and board certified in Ambulatory Care Pharmacy. I teach an Integrated Pharmacotherapy (IPT) course in opioid management and coordinate a course in Toxicology. I have devoted much of my professional time to pain management policy, training and education. I have served on several editorial boards including the Journal of Opioid Management, Journal of Pharmacotherapy specializing in Pain Management content, and Journal of Research in Interprofessional Practice and Education. As a clinical pharmacist, I serve at the Sacred Heart Community Clinic located on a large church campus in the Austin Texas area. As a healthcare team, the healthcare providers provide approximately 5000 medically underserved patient visits per year. These patients range from young adults to up to 65 years of age having conditions including pain, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression. In the first ten years of my practice, I served as an operating room pharmacist working with a pain management team of anesthesiologist and surgeons. My responsibilities included providing analgesic drug information, meeting accreditation requirements, maintaining analgesic/anesthetic inventory, and preparing anesthetic formulations in the operating room hospital setting. In the year 2000, I was promoted to a clinical pharmacist specialist in pain management position in a large academic, flag ship teaching hospital with fourteen affiliated hospitals in the healthcare system. In this position, I helped with programs in the healthcare system related to treating patients with acute, chronic, and end-of-life pain. A multidisciplinary pain committee was established having anesthesiologists, surgeons, psychologists, physical therapists, rehabilitation specialists, neurologists, pharmacologists, chaplain, and a social worker.

Tatyana,Igumenova,Associate Professor,"My laboratory is broadly interested in understanding the structural basis of signal transduction events that occur at the membrane surface. These events are mediated by signaling proteins that reversibly associate with membranes in response to binding second messengers, such as Ca2+ ions, diacylglycerol, and phosphoinositides. One of the key kinases regulating these signal transduction pathways is the Protein Kinase C (PKC) family. Aberrant levels of PKC expression or activity have been implicated in a large number of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiac failure, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Despite the significance of PKC in signal transduction and human health, the structural and dynamical basis of its activation upon binding to lipid membranes remains elusive.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n1c6e6632

Thomas,Isakeit,Professor and Extension Specialist,"I respond to the needs of Texas growers with research and educational efforts aimed at solving their plant disease problems. I work on diseases of field crops, with emphasis on major diseases of cotton, corn, and sorghum in Texas.   I also work on diseases of some vegetables, with emphasis on watermelons.  With cotton, I am evaluating fungicides for control of Phymatotrichopsis root rot, in collaboration with agronomists, IPM agents and county agents throughout the state.  For corn, I've emphasized aflatoxin control,  through collaborative projects on host resistance with the corn breeder, Dr. Seth Murray and plant pathologist, Dr. Mike Kolomiets.  I also do field studies on the use of atoxigenic strains for biological control of aflatoxin.  My sorghum emphasis is management of metalaxyl-resistant sorghum downy mildew strains.  I also collaborate with USDA-ARS plant pathologist, Dr. Louis Prom, on sorghum anthracnose and grain mold research.<br /><br /><br /><br />While it is essential to respond to disease problems as they arise, I strive to anticipate how changes in agriculture in the future will affect plant diseases and approaches for their control.

A funded research area in severe accident analysis has come about that allows me to return to my PhD research.  <br /><br />I believe that developing a strong, externally funded program is an area to be emphasized, particularly because I have interests in experimental research.  To this end, I have maintained a continuously funded laboratory with major investments into equipment that allow me to acquire unique, more challenging data than that from many other heat transfer laboratories.  In particular, my 157-kW steam generator system allows me to perform steam-water experiments at elevated pressure for two-phase (gas-liquid) phenomena occurring in nuclear reactors, whereas much of the published data is for air-water systems at atmospheric pressure.

Narendra,Kumar,Associate Professor,"1.   Obesity associated metabolic syndrome (MetS) is both a US and a worldwide epidemic and a major burden to healthcare system. Chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) is a well-established characteristic of the obese-human condition and though, the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is the first tissue that interacts with dietary components and luminal microbiota both of which are known to regulate obesity, the research on the role of GI-mucosa in obesity associated MetS is lacking. Findings from my lab support a key role of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, in intestinal and systemic CLGI associated obesity and diabetes in both an animal-model and in humans. Our publications, and unpublished data indicate that Jak3 regulates; colonic and systemic CLGI, and multiple symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Our goal is to determine the associated underlying mechanisms. Our current focus is on tissue-specific roles of Jak3 and associated signaling complexes in CLGI-onset as a precursor for;  (a) obesity and diabetes,  (b) Obesity and Alzheimer's disease, and  (c) inflammatory bowel disease.<br /><br /> 2.   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that includes Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of gastrointestinal tract. Annual death from these diseases are over 70,000.00, and the incidences of new cases have been rising over the years.  Because the repairs of intestinal mucosa (Restitution) are compromised during IBD, the research focus of our lab is to dissect the roles of intestinal epithelial, intestinal immune cells and gut microbiota in mucosal restitution. Our lab was pioneered the functions of Jak3 in intestinal epithelial mucosa. We show that IL-2 (a cytokine produced during intestinal inflammation) promotes mucosal wound repair through Jak3 complexed with villin, ShcA, and ?-catenin. Studies are underway to define the tissue-specific Jak3-mediated signaling pathways that regulate CLGI as a precursor for the onset of IBD.",Associate Professor,Pharmaceutical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5bcfc45e

Two separate activation domains in this protein direct its action at small RNA vs. mRNA gene promoters.

In the circulatory system, the amount of blood delivered to each tissue can be regulated by the activity of arterial microvessels (<100  m in diameter). Changes in vascular tone, i.e., constriction or dilation of these microvessels, will decrease or increase blood supply to the tissue, respectively. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of vascular tone are not completely understood. Our current research focuses on the regulation of microvascular tone by hemodynamic (e.g., pressure and shear stress), metabolic (e.g., adenosine, osmolarity, K+, pH, pO2) and neural (adrenergic receptors) factors. To have an integrative view on the flow regulation, this basic information are reconstructed using mathematical model and computer simulation technology.

Arthur,Laganowsky,Associate Professor,"A long-term research goal of our group is to determine the molecular basis behind protein-lipid interactions and how these interactions can modulate the structure and function of membrane proteins, including their interactions with signaling molecules. What determines the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids, and the coupling between lipid binding events and function remains a key knowledge gap in the field; one that if addressed will significantly advance our understanding of how lipids participate in both normal and pathophysiological processes of membrane proteins. Therefore, there is a critical need to expand our fundamental knowledge in this emerging field by applying and developing innovative approaches to elucidate how lipids modulate the structure function of membrane proteins. To this end, we are studying a number of ion channels, receptors and other types of membrane proteins.",Associate Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n542411e4

Jianrong,Li,"Professor, Neurobiology, Veterinary Integrative Biosciences","The central goal of our research is to understand how oligodendroglial development in the mammalian central nervous system is regulated in health and disease. Specifically, we are interested in molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in oligodendrocyte death as occurring in white matter injuries, such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. Because in most CNS diseases, multiple cell types including neurons, glial cells and vascular cells are involved via complex interactions, we investigate, at the cellular and molecular level, the role of microglia and astrocytes in the process of oligodendrocyte development, differentiation and cell death. We use a variety of methods including primary<br /><br />cell cultures and transgenic and knockout animals to elucidate signal transduction pathways in mediating oligodendrocyte injury.<br /><br />The second focus of our laboratory is to elucidate the signals that promote oligodendrocyte survival and regeneration/remyelination after injury, and to study cell-cell interactions that regulate remyelination. These studies should contribute significantly to our understanding of mechanisms of oligodendrocyte development and injury, and provide new clues for potential prevention and treatment of human white matter diseases.",Professor,Veterinary Integrative Biosciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3ef91dcf
Pingwei,Li,Professor,"The research in my lab focuses on elucidating the structural basis of innate immune responses towards microbial nucleic acids. The cGAS/STING pathway plays a central role in innate immunity toward bacterial and viral DNA. cGAS is activated by dsDNA and catalyzes the synthesis of a cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which binds to the adaptor STING that mediates the recruitment and activation of protein kinase TBK1 and transcription factor IRF-3. Activated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of type I interferons (IFN), an important family of antiviral cytokine. To elucidate the mechanism of cGAS activation, we determined the structures of cGAS in isolation and in complex with DNA. The cGAS/DNA complex structure reveals that cGAS interacts with DNA through two binding sites. Enzyme assays and IFN-? reporter assays of cGAS mutants demonstrate that interactions at both DNA binding sites are essential for cGAS activation. To investigate how cGAMP activates STING, we determined the structures of STING in isolation and in complex with cGAMP. These structures reveal that STING forms a V-shaped dimer and binds cGAMP at the dimer interface. We have also determined the structures of TBK1 in complex with two inhibitors, which show that TBK1 exhibits an I?B kinase fold with distinct domain arrangement. To elucidate the mechanism of IRF-3 recruitment by STING, we determined the structure of a phosphorylated STING peptide bound to IRF-3. To understand how phosphorylation activates IRF-3, we solved the structure of an IRF-3 phosphomimetic mutant bound to CBP, which reveals how phosphorylation induces the dimerization and activation of IRF-3.",Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n31ebad17

Paul,Lindahl,Professor,"One of our two current research areas involves iron metabolism in mitochondria. The iron imported into these organelles is assembled into iron-sulfur clusters and heme prosthetic groups. Some of these centers are exported into the cytosol, while others are installed into mitochondrial apo-proteins. All of these processes are regulated in healthy cells, but various genetic mutations giving rise to diseases can cause iron to accumulate (e.g. Friedreich's ataxia) or become depleted (e.g. Sideroblastic anemia). We have developed a biophysical approach involving Mossbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and electronic absorption spectroscopy, to study the entire iron content of intact mitochondria in healthy and genetically altered cells. This Systems Biology approach allows us to characterize the ""iron-ome"" of mitochondria at an unprecedented level of detail. We are also using analytical tools (e.g. liquid chromatography) to identify complexes that are involved in ""trafficking"" iron into and out of the organelle.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our other research area involves mathematical modeling of cellular self-replication on the mechanistic biochemical level. We collaborate on this multidisciplinary NSF-sponsored project with a mathematician at the University of Houston (Professor Jeffrey Morgan). We have developed a modeling framework that facilitates such modeling efforts, and have designed a number of very simple and symbolic in silico cells that exhibit self-replicative behavior. Our minimal in silico cell model includes just 5 components and 5 reactions. A second generation model includes a more realistic mechanism of mitotic regulation. One novel aspect of our approach is that cellular concentration dynamics impact (and are impacted by) cellular geometry. By minimizing membrane bending energies, we are now calculating cell geometry during growth and division. Our results suggest that the ""pinching"" observed in real cells is enforced by cytoskeletal structures.",Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc9ce621b

To study protein posttranslational modifications, we have constructed methods for the site-specific installation of lysine acetylation and methylation in proteins and will apply them to study functional roles of these two modifications on p53, a tumor suppressor protein. We have also developed a strategy to site-specifically install two noncanonical amino acids into one protein in E. coli and are applying this approach to construct biosensors for small organic molecules and metal ions. Phage display is an efficient method to identify peptides for therapeutic interventions. However, a phage display peptide library has limited structure motifs and functional groups because only 20 natural amino acids can be used to generate a library. We plan to expand the chemical diversity of a phage display library by incorporating multiple noncanonical amino acids and chemically modifying them to extend functional diversities.

Robert,Lucchese,Professor,"We study various processes which involve electrons being scattered by or ejected from molecules. These processes include ectron-molecule collision, electron impact ionization, and photoionization. Recently we have worked closely with experimental groups around the world to study molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions. In these studies we can make detailed comparisons of experimental data and theoretical predictions of the probability of the emission of the photoelectron in specific directions relative to the orientation of the molecule. We have also considered electron scattering from cage molecules such as C60 and C20. In these systems we have found a new class of scattering resonances where the electron is trapped inside the cage. These processes are important in such physical systems as upper atmospheres, plasma processing of semiconductors, and surface analysis.<br /><br /><br /><br />A second area of interest is the structure and dynamics of hydrogen bonded clusters. This work is done in collaboration with Professor J. W. Bevan's research group where the corresponding systems are studied experimentally. We develop potential energy surfaces using both experimental data and by performing quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations. These potentials are then used in quantum mechanical calculations of the vibrational motion of the complexes with particular attention being focused on the large amplitude motion found in hydrogen bonded systems. Currently we are studying the complexes CO--HI and (HBr)2.

Michael,Manson,Professor,"Bacteria have a limited behavioral repertoire. Their most conspicuous behavior is chemotaxis - the pursuit of molecules that are favorable to acquire and the avoidance of chemicals that are best to avoid. The simplicity of bacterial motility and chemotaxis and the amenability of the model species Escherichia coli to genetic, biochemical and physiological manipulation have facilitated rapid advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of biological energy conversion and signal transduction.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our laboratory studies the inputs and outputs of chemotaxis. Ligands interact with the periplasmic receptor domain of a chemotactic signal transducer that spans the cell membrane. This interaction is converted into an intracellular signal that is communicated to the flagella. Molecules can be sensed either by binding directly to a receptor or by first interacting with a periplasmic binding protein, which then interacts with a receptor.",Professor||Professor,Biology||Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne190242a

This work falls within the conceptual framework of ecological morphology & physiology and is conducted at the functional organismal level (morphology and physiology), behavioral, and ecological levels. The central concept of this field is that morphology and physiology influences an organism's ecology through constraints of behavioral performance, which is the capacity of an animal to exploit its natural resources, and explore its environment. Although investigations of morphology, physiology, and behavior stand on their own, ultimately the integration of these studies can explain how organisms interact with their environment, the evolution of functional complexes, and the pressure selections involved in driving adaptations.",Professor||Professor,Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences||Marine Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n27bd8535

Thomas,Mcknight,Professor and Head,"My lab is currently investigating mechanisms that regulate telomerase activity in plants. We previously showed that the pattern of telomerase expression in plants is remarkably similar to the pattern seen in humans, despite fundamental differences in development between plants and animals. Telomerase is abundantly expressed in reproductive organs but is undetectable in most vegetative organs (Fitzgerald et al., 1996). Additionally, telomerase can be induced in leaves and other vegetative organs by exposure to exogenous auxin.<br /><br /><br /><br />To isolate genes that regulate telomerase, we screened a large population of activation tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, and found that several lines that ectopically express telomerase in leaves. The first line we characterized over-expressed a gene encoding a small zinc finger transcription factor we designated TELOMERASE ACTIVATOR 1 (Ren et al., 2004). This factor does not bind to the promoter for TERT, which encodes the catalytically active subunit of telomerase. Instead, it binds to and activates transcription of BT2, a gene encoding a component of a ubiquitin ligase (Ren et al., 2007). Our working model is that the BT2 ubiquitin ligase marks a telomerase repressor for destruction, thereby allowing expression of telomerase. Efforts in the lab are currently focused on identifying the presumed telomerase repressor protein and other proteins that interact with BT2.",Professor and Head,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5c3b294a

Jerome,Menet,Assistant Professor,"Most organisms from bacteria to humans exhibit 24-hours rhythms in their biochemistry, physiology and behavior. Best exemplified by the sleep/wake cycle, these rhythms are remarkably widespread and include in humans hormonal (e.g., melatonin, insulin, cortisol), metabolic (e.g., glucose, cholesterol), physiological and behavioral oscillations. In fact, most biological functions are rhythmic and are set to perform optimally at the most appropriate time of the day. For example, the human digestion process performs better during the day when we are supposed to eat.<br /><br /><br /><br />These circadian rhythms are generated by ""molecular clocks"", which consist of a few ""clock genes"" interacting in feedback loops, and which drive the rhythmic expression of a large number of genes, i.e. ~10% of the transcriptome in any tissues. This wide impact of clock genes in regulating gene expression is underscored by the surprisingly large number of pathologies developed by clock-deficient mice. In addition to being arrhythmic, these mice indeed develop pathologies as diverse as mania-like behaviors, learning and memory defects, depression, drug addiction, insomnia, metabolic diseases, arthropathy, hematopoiesis defects and cancers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Research in our lab aims at characterizing how circadian clocks and clock genes regulate gene expression to provide insights into how and why clock dysfuntion leads to a wide spectra of pathologies. To this end, we are using a wide-range of molecular and biochemical techniques to investigate the circadian clock function at the genome-wide level (e.g., next-generation sequencing). We are currently extending some of our recent results and focus on 1) how clock genes rhythmically regulate chromatin environment and 2) the mechanisms involved in rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf680fb91

Christine,Merlin,Associate Professor,"Our research broadly lies in understanding how organisms respond and adapt to changing environments, with an emphasis on circadian biology. Organisms from bacteria to humans use circadian clocks to control a plethora of biochemical, physiological and behavioral rhythms. These clocks are synchronized to daily and seasonal environmental changes to allow organisms to tune specific activities at the appropriate times of day or year.<br /><br />In our laboratory, we use the eastern North American migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) as a model system to study animal clock mechanisms and the role of circadian clocks and clock genes in a fascinating biological output, the animal long-distance migration. Every fall, like clockwork, millions of monarch butterflies start migrating thousands of miles from North America to reach their overwintering sites in central Mexico. During their journey south, migrating monarchs use a time-compensated sun compass orientation mechanism to maintain a constant flight bearing. Circadian clocks located in the antennae provide the critical internal timing device for compensation of the sun movement across the sky over the course of the day. The recent sequencing of the monarch genome and the establishment of genetic tools to knockout clock genes (and others) in vivo using nuclease-mediated gene targeting approaches provides us with a unique opportunity to uncover the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the butterfly clockwork, its migratory behavior and their interplay.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5a23a5d7

Loss of plasticity and synaptic transmission is one of the earliest hallmarks of AD and one of the best correlates of cognitive dysfunction in aging. It is virtually impossible for this to be studied in humans, and thus little progress has been made in developing therapeutics to resurrect synaptic function. We have developed a mouse model of age-related cognitive impairment in which we can use light (optogenetics) in order to uncover the faulty synaptic mechanisms that promote cognitive dysfunction observed in aging and early AD.",Postdoctoral Research Associate||Research Assistant Professor,Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics||Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc5b013b5

Rita,Moyes,Instructional Associate Professor,"he immune system is a defense mechanism that has evolved in vertebrates to protect them from invading pathogens and cancer. The study of the immune system in the context of host - parasite interactions has been the focus of my studies. Generation of an effective immune response involves two major cell types: lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Lymphocytes confer the attributes of specificity, diversity, memory, self/nonself recognition to the immune system. Lymphocytes can be divided into two cell types: B cells which are responsible for antibody production and T cells which elaborate cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that regulate the intensity and duration of the immune response by exerting a variety of effects on lymphocytes and other immune cells. This complex network of cells and cell products have numerous mechanisms yet to be characterized.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am currently involved in the production of monoclonal antibodies to various proteins of interest in the research of the Biology faculty. Using the chicken model, my recent research has focused on the identification and characterization of various cytokines which potentiate the innate immune responses of poultry that effectively prevent organ invasion by Salmonella. Previous studies have involved the use of a mouse tumor model to evaluate various cytokine treatments for tumor reduction. The goal was to reduce cytokine toxicity which is seen with large doses while effectively reducing tumor growth.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have also studied the human T cell response to Schistosoma mansoni, an intestinal parasite, by utilizing human T cell clones.",Instructional Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ndc57e124

Albert,Mulenga,"Professor and associate head, Veterinary Pathobiology","For generations ticks and tick borne diseases have had significant impact of animal health and livestock productivity around the world. In public health the effect of ticks and tick borne diseases is also tremendous. Since the 1980s when the causative agent of Lyme disease was described, numerous human tick borne diseases have been reported. In absence of effective vaccines against major tick borne diseases, prevention of animal and human tick borne disease infections relies on the use chemicals (acaricides) to kill ticks. Although acaricide based tick control methods are effective in the short-term, they do not offer a permanent solution because of serious limitations such as ticks developing resistance and contamination of the environment and the food chain. Immunization of animals against is a validated alternative tick control method. The attraction is that tick vaccines will be effective against both acaricide resistant and susceptible tick populations. The major limiting factor is the availability of effective tick vaccine targets. The tick cannot cause damage to host or transmit disease agents without successful feeding. Thus, our plan is to understand molecular mechanisms of how ticks accomplish feeding. In this way we will find targets that will be used for development of effective tick vaccines. We are currently studying the feeding physiology of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). According to the US Centers for Disease Control, these two medically important tick species transmit a combined nine of the 14 human tick borne disease agents in the United States. Major work is on discovery and characterization of proteins that the Lone Star and the Blacklegged tick into animals every 24h through out feeding. The area of particular emphasis is to understanding roles of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) the blacklegged tick and the Lone Star tick inject into animals during feeding. We have identified serpins",Professor and associate head,College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne8f0c620

Beiyan,Nan,Assistant Professor,"I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of fundamental biological processes in bacteria. My lab uses soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus as the model organism. Several aspects of M. xanthus make it an ideal model for understanding bacterial physiology. First, M. xanthus cells utilize sophisticated systems to move on solid surfaces, which involve cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins, filamentous cytoskeletons, membrane channels, cell wall, and cell surface components. Second, cells constantly communicate with each other and with their environment. Cells usually move in coordinated groups but also as isolated ""adventurous"" individuals, which allows this bacterium to feed on soil detritus and prey on other microorganisms. Third, when the availability of nutrients or prey decrease in the environment, most cells exhibit behaviors that include aggregation into fruiting bodies and conversion of individual cells into spores.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have been using the super resolution photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) to track single molecule dynamics of proteins in live bacterial cells. With this technique, I have achieved 10 millisecond time resolution (100 frames per second) and 80 nm spatial resolution. These studies were initiated because the most widely used fluorescence microscopy techniques (including confocal, deconvolution, etc.) can only provide resolution to about 200 nm due to the diffraction of light, which is often insufficient for many studies because of the small size of bacterial cells (usually a few hundred nanometers in diameter).<br /><br /><br /><br />Our research topics cover motility, development (fruiting body formation and biofilm formation), cytoskeleton, and cell wall assembly.",Assistant Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n3fe4c57e

Anne,Newell-Fugate,Assistant Professor,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent reproductive endocrine disorder in women and results in a substantial financial burden to the American healthcare system. PCOS is characterized by an/oligoovulation, polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism. PCOS patients are also at risk for the development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. My laboratory focuses on the effects of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance on androgen steroidogenesis and the interrelationship between androgens and insulin signaling in steroidogenic tissues and adipose tissue. An additional focus of my laboratory is the effect of novel fat sources on metabolic and reproductive function in the context of obesity. Using cell culture and rodent and porcine models, my research program examines the direct and indirect effects of obesity and resulting hyperandrogenemia on steroidogenesis and reproductive function in females. I also have a strong interest in wildlife and zoo animal endocrinology and reproductive physiology. In the past, I have conducted endocrine based research projects on the Pallas' Cat and African Wild Dog. My current research examines the effect of the introduction of novel pheromones versus novel animals on fecal steroid metabolite concentrations, behavior, and estrous cyclicity in captive, female Red River Hogs. I am also working with zoo-based collaborators to develop an eletroejaculation and artificial insemination protocol for Suidae (pig) and Tayassuidae (peccary) species and am engaged in a retrospective characterization of reproductive tract lesions in pigs and peccaries in relation to age, parity and contraceptive use.",Assistant Professor,Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n283bcbde

Joseph,Orr,Assistant Professor,"My work aims to understand how internal goals and external environments influence voluntary task selection. The primary goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility, the ability to switch between tasks or behaviors quickly and efficiently. Cognitive flexibility is disrupted in several mental health disorders such as psychosis, addiction, and autism. Most studies of cognitive flexibility rely on external cues to determine when and which task to perform, but in the real world this choice is under our voluntary control. While external influences may make these decisions difficult, e.g., seeing ads for junk food when we are trying to make healthy choices, they are nevertheless under a degree of internal control. My work takes the unique perspective of focusing on voluntary control in cognitive flexibility. I take a multimodal approach, using brain imaging (fMRI) and measures of electrical brain activity (EEG) to examine the dynamics of the underlying neural mechanisms, and electrical brain stimulation to better understand brain-behavior causal links. More recently, I've been applying computational modeling to determine the exact components underlying task selection. The long-term objective of my research is to understand the factors that limit flexibility to better inform treatments for psychopathology and to maximize flexibility in healthy individuals.",Assistant Professor,Psychological and Brain Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/na5b2b1b2

William,Park,Professor,"Most of our work in the last few years has focused on manipulating starch biosynthesis in plants. This has led to the identification of a number of specific DNA polymorphisms that have a profound impact on the structure and functional properties of starch granules. Interestingly, the effect of some of these polymorphisms is temperature sensitive. For example, a key G/T polymorphism at the 5' leader intron splice site of rice granule bound starch synthase has little phenotypic effect at 18 ?C, but at 25 ?C it activates an alternate splice site that results in a premature open reading frame. At 32 ?C, a third nonconsensus TT/GT splice site is activated. This type of temperature sensitivity is one of the key factors responsible for the complex genotype x environment relationships seen in starch structure and represents a good target for manipulation via biotechnology.

Debdeep,Pati,Associate Professor,"My research centers around methodological aspects of Bayesian statistics and its application to large scale complex data. I am particularly focused on developing methodology in a broad range of areas including semi-parametric density regression, shrinkage priors for anisotropic function estimation, variable selection with non-Gaussian errors, massive covariance matrix estimation, surface reconstruction and imaging and modeling shapes of non-Euclidean objects. I enjoy developing methodology that has an immediate motivation and impact to a particular application area, while being broadly applicable and leading to foundational questions. In the Bayes paradigm this often involves developing new classes of flexible prior distributions for densities, conditional densities, functions, sparse vectors, matrices or tensors. It is fascinating to explore the structure of the spaces on which the priors are supported while studying how the posterior concentrates as increasing amounts of data are collected. Studying these spaces becomes more challenging outside of unconstrained Euclidean spaces, such as in studying closed surfaces and other shapes, and when the dimension explodes. While Bayesian hierarchical models offer an unified and coherent framework for structured modeling and inference, two key challenges persist. First, as one moves away from simple parametric models, understanding properties of a posterior distribution poses a stiff challenge. Second, even if the true posterior has desirable properties, sampling from the posterior distribution in large scale problems commonly face scalability issues. This is relevant both for high-dimensional and big data problems. My research aims at addressing these challenges simultaneously, developing new theory to evaluate the associated procedures and developing scalable and highly efficient algorithms for Bayesian computation.",Associate Professor,Statistics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ndbea61f5

Ky,Pohler,Assistant Professor,"Dr. Pohler's research interest focus on understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms that control reproductive efficiency in cattle. More specifically his lab is interested in the mechanisms that lead to embryonic and fetal mortality in cattle and development of management strategies to overcome these losses. Embryonic mortality can be classified into early (< d 28 of gestation) or late (> d 28 of gestation) depending on the exact timing at which it occurs during gestation. Reports of high fertilization rates after a single insemination (~90%), followed by pregnancy rates of 60 to 70% on d 28 in cows indicate that early embryonic mortality may be 20 to 30% in beef cows. Documented causes of early embryonic mortality range from genetic abnormalities to uterine-embryo asynchrony to failure of maternal recognition of pregnancy and this has been an area of intense investigation.  Late embryonic mortality (> d 28 of gestation) has been reported in both beef/dairy cattle and may vary from 3.2 to 42.7%.  Currently, there is very little known about the causes of late embryonic mortality. However, the economic consequences of each unit of late embryonic mortality are greater than that of early mortality. Along with the increased economic consequences, late embryonic mortality is becoming more evident in both the beef and dairy industries based on the shift to early pregnancy diagnosis (~d28-35 of gestation).",Assistant Professor,Animal Science,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfd0f4c67

She pays particular attention to social movement rhetorics and public memories about resistance and white heteronormative male supremacy.

However, what determines when cells initiate their division remains mysterious. It is as if we are staring at a beautiful engine, with little knowledge about what turns it on. How cells are set off to a new round of cell division, remains as one of the most fundamental, unanswered questions. It is virtually unknown which cellular pathways affect initiation of division, which factors operate within each pathway, the extent of interactions between pathways, and how each pathway is molecularly linked to the machinery of cell division. Our studies aim to answer these questions using baker's yeast.

The current main research effort in our lab is to understand. Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based appendages extending from the basal body of almost all eukaryotic cells, and are classified as either motile or primary. Motile cilia or flagella such as Chlamydomonas flagella, sperm flagella and respiratory tract epithelial cell cilia are responsible for movement or generation of fluid flow.  In contrast, primary cilia are non-motile organelles that are critically involved in visual, olfactory and auditory signal transduction and play key roles in regulation of gene expression, development and animal behavior.  Ciliary defects are linked to ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, retinal degeneration, situs inversus, hydrocephalus, polydactyly and obesity. Our lab uses a combination of biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics approaches to understand the principles of ciliogenesis and its regulation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Flagellar axoneme structure and motility<br /><br />The waveform of cilia is conserved, no matter whether the cilia are on green algae Chlamydomonas or mammalian epithelia found in the airways, the uterus and fallopian tubes, the efferent ducts of the testes, and the ventricular system of the brain.

Antonietta,Quigg,Associate Vice President,"The lab's research is focused on phytoplankton as model organisms to address questions related to water, climate and energy. We use quantitative experimental approaches to elucidate the importance of biotic and abiotic factors influencing phytoplankton dynamics (community composition, physiology, ecology) in field and laboratory-settings. It is collaborative, multidisciplinary and international (see publications list). However, does not follow the 20th century paradigm of striving to be the best in a narrowly defined field. Rather, our research paradigm is to continuously generate new ideas and new collaborations and alliances, which is needed to do well in the 21st century. In this way, the research we perform in the lab is capacity building for a new generation, with whom I have a strong commitment.<br /><br /><br /><br />One of the greatest challenges facing the world today is ensuring an adequate supply and quality of water to meet rapidly increasing human needs whilst securing the continued health of our waterways. The goal of much of the lab's research is to understand and predict interactions between water systems, climate change, land use and ecosystem function and services in estuaries and coasts. We are working predominately in the Gulf of Mexico, Galveston Bay and other Texas bayous to address these concerns, but also have studies with colleagues in other regions of the world. A parallel goal is addressing emerging issues for the 21st century, including but not limited to, the fate and transport of engineered nanoparticles, oil pollutants and other man-made materials in the environment. Phytoplankton are directly and indirectly impacted by these pollutants, such that there is an increased potential for bioaccumulation and biomagnification to higher trophic levels.

Frank,Raushel,Distinguished Professor,"Enzymes catalyze a remarkable variety of chemical reactions with extremely high rate enhancements and very selective substrate specificity. The research efforts in our laboratory are directed towards a more complete understanding of the fundamental principles involved in enzyme-catalyzed chemistry and the dependence on protein structure. The pursuit of this information will provide the framework for the rational and combinatorial redesign of these complex molecules in an effort to exploit and develop the properties of enzyme active sites for a variety of chemical, biological, and medicinal uses. The techniques that we are using to solve these problems include steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics, NMR and EPR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and the synthesis of inhibitors and suicide substrates. We are also using recombinant DNA methods to construct new proteins with novel catalytic properties. These efforts are currently being directed to the reactions catalyzed by phosphotriesterase and enzymes involves in the degradation of lignin and the metabolism of novel carbohydrates from the human gut microbiome.<br /><br /><br /><br />The phosphotriesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of organophosphate insecticides and other toxic organophosphate nerve agents. We have discovered that the active site of this protein consists of a unique binuclear metal center for the activation of water. We are now investigating the structure and properties of this metal center as a model system for the evolution of enzyme structure and function. Toward this end we have mutated the active site of this enzyme in a research project to create novel enzymes with the ability to detect, destroy, and detoxify various chemical warfare agents such as sarin, soman, and VX.

A prominent feature of our research is to investigate how cell-cell signaling and downstream gene-interactions control development.  One project in the lab focuses on how cell signaling regulates ectodermal patterning during gastrulation to establish the otic placode, the precursor of the inner ear.  Our recent work shows that localized Fgf signaling is especially critical for inducing formation of the otic placode, and members of the Pax2/5/8 family of transcription factors are important mediators of Fgf signaling.  During later stages of inner ear development, we are exploring how sensory hair cells and neurons are regulated.  Our studies address how these cells initially form, how they are genetically maintained, and how they become specialized for hearing vs. balance.  We are also investigating how zebrafish can replace dead and damaged hair cells, an ability that mammals have lost.  The inability to regenerate hair cells explains why humans show progressive irreversible hearing loss as we age.

Jay,Rooker,Professor,"My research centers on the community and population ecology of aquatic organisms, with a special emphasis on marine fishes. I am particularly interested in linkages between habitat selection, individual responses, and survival. My work is both laboratory and field-based, and I typically use both quantitative and experimental approaches to elucidate the importance of biotic and abiotic factors that influence growth, condition, and survival. In addition, we are currently using a variety of natural markers to solve ecological problems. Otolith chemistry is being used to retrospectively determine the environmental histories of marine fishes. The premise of otolith chemistry is that certain elements or isotopes are incorporated into otoliths in proportion to their concentrations in the environment, and thus we use these elemental fingerprints to distinguish individuals from different environments or regions. We also use dietary tracers (stable isotopes, fatty acids) to investigate marine food web structure since consumer tissues reflect the isotopic and fatty acid composition of prey in a predictable manor. These natural biomarkers provide time-integrated or long-term measures of diet, and both approaches afford information on source(s) of organic matter supporting local food webs as well as trophic relationships of associated consumers.

Michael,Rosynek,Professor and Associate Department Head,"Heterogeneous catalytic processes form the basis for much of the chemical and petroleum processing industries. Solid catalysts enable reactions to occur at sufficiently high rates to be commercially feasible. In many cases, proper selection of a suitable catalyst also permits reaction pathways and product selectivities to occur that would not be kinetically possible in the absence of the catalyst. In our laboratory, we employ kinetic measurements of selected reactions, in combination with a variety of optical and surface spectroscopic and physical characterization techniques, to investigate the surface properties and detailed modes of operation of zeolites, metal oxides and supported metal catalysts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Among the more challenging problems in the field of heterogeneous catalysis is that of selectively oxidizing small alkanes to higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates in high yields. We are currently investigating, for example, the catalyzed oxidative coupling of methane to C2hydrocarbon products. We have established that this reaction occurs via a heterogeneous-homogeneous reaction mechanism, in which the first step is homolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in methane at an O-site on the oxide catalyst surface. The resulting methyl radicals then emanate into the gas phase where they either undergo coupling to the desired C2 products or enter into a series of chain branching homogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of undesired COx products. We are employing x-ray photoelectron, FT-IR and in situ Raman spectroscopies to characterize the nature of the active sites on the catalyst surfaces. Additional studies using isotopic labelling and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy are providing details about the mechanism of this complex reaction system. Other projects involve studies of the direct selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates, such as formaldehyde and methanol, and to aromatic products.",Professor and Associate Department Head,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n9ed54600

We are also investigating the structure(s) of model peptides in an effort to better describe folding/unfolding and structure of membrane and intrinsically disordered (IDP) proteins. Peptides take on very different 2?, 3? and 4? structure, which determine or influence bio-activity. In the presence of lipid vesicles peptides can exist as solution-phase species, ""absorbed"" on lipid bilayers or ""inserted"" (as a monomer or multimer) in lipid bilayers. By what mechanism do peptides interact with lipid membranes to affect these structural changes, how do peptide-lipid interactions promote self-assembly to form intermediates that eventually yield aggregates, i.e., amyloid fibrils, or how does metal ion coordination affect the structure of metalloproteins? Mass spectrometry-based experiments, hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange, chemical 'foot-printing' and gas-phase (ion-molecule and ion-ion reaction chemistry) and solution-phase chemical modifications, have expanded our abilities to address such questions, and new instrumental approaches, esp. ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) combined with enhanced molecular dynamics simulations (MDS), have become standard tools for structural-mass spectrometry studies.

Kathryn,Ryan,Instructional Associate Professor,"1. Delineate the function of the Ran cycle in NPC assembly<br /><br />Model for NPC AssemblyRan is a small GTPase that cycles between a GTP and GDP bound form to regulate many nuclear processes. All 4 components of the Ran cycle were isolated in the npa screen. Characterization of these mutants revealed membrane defects and the accumulation of nucleoporin containing vesicles in the cytoplasm. The accumulation of such vesicles in these npa mutants suggests that NPC assembly involves a Ran-mediated vesicular fusion event at the outer nuclear envelope. In this model of NPC assembly, a subset of nucleoporins is first concentrated in vesicles (A). When the vesicles fuse with the outer nuclear membrane in a Ran-dependent manner (B), a critical, localized concentration of these nucleoporins triggers pore formation (C) and nucleates new NPC assembly (D and E). To test the model, work is being done to characterize these vesicles. This includes biochemical approaches to purify vesicles and cell biological and genetic approaches to determine how vesicle-associated proteins contribute to NPC assembly. In addition, we are working to understand how Ran interacts with these vesicles to mediate vesicle fusion to the outer nuclear membrane.<br /><br /><br /><br />2. Define additional steps in the NPC assembly pathway<br /><br />There are events both upstream and downstream of the Ran cycle in the assembly pathway. Further cloning and characterization of mutants from the npa collection will continue to identify factors involved in other steps of NPC biogenesis and provide a platform from which to study these discrete events.",Instructional Associate Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n613870d1

Hays,Rye,Associate Professor,"A fundamental principle of biology is the use of chemical energy in the form of ATP to assemble, disassemble and alter macromolecular structure.  Specialized control proteins known as molecular chaperones are often responsible for this activity and have been recognized in recent years to be essential for regulating many aspects of cellular biology.  Using a variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques, the Rye lab focuses on three fundamental cellular processes that require molecular chaperones:  (1) protein folding (2) protein disaggregation and (3) vesicle trafficking.  In each of these cases, large quantities ATP are burned, resulting in molecular organization in the case of protein folding, and molecular disassembly and remodeling in the case of protein disaggregation and vesicle trafficking.  We are interested in understanding the detailed biophysical mechanisms that underpin these events.  Why are these processes so energetically expensive?  Are there any similarities in how the energy is used between these very different molecular processes?  Are there general principles of energy transduction in biology that can be gleaned by comparing these examples with other molecular machines, such as cytoskeletal motors?  Understanding how molecular chaperones control protein and membrane organization will provide key insights into not only basic cell biology, but will also illuminate aspects of many diseases that spring from aberrant protein and membrane dynamics.",Associate Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/ne7fb85e1

Matthew,Sachs,Professor,"Understanding the mechanisms by which upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in mRNA transcripts control gene expression is currently the major focus of my laboratory. A substantial component of this work is focused on the uORF-encoded fungal arginine attenuator peptide (AAP). The major goal of this work is to understand the mechanism by which a nascent peptide encoded by this uORF controls the movement of ribosomes on mRNA and regulates gene expression. Control mechanisms mediated by uORFs and nascent peptides exist in mammals, fungi, plants, viruses, and bacteria, but relatively little is known of the molecular details of such control. The AAP is encoded by a uORF in the 5?-leader regions of mRNAs specifying the first enzyme in fungal arginine (Arg) biosynthesis. Synthesis of the AAP rapidly reduces gene expression in response to Arg. AAP-mediated regulation is observed in vivo in both Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro, using fungal, plant and animal extracts. The nascent AAP causes the ribosome to stall when the concentration of Arg is high.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfe74574c

Emile,Schweikert,Professor,"Our research explores the extreme limits of analytical chemistry: the characterization of atto to zeptomole quantities of molecules. The aim is to detect such amounts of analyte within nanometric surface volumes. The goal is chemical imaging of surfaces with exquisite spatial resolution. The first challenge is to conceive methods and instrumentation for the accurate identification of as little as a few thousand molecules. The second challenge is to convert a measurement into analytical information. A measurement by itself, even a spectacular one such as detection of a single atom or molecule, is not sufficient. Measurements must be related to the physico-chemical system sampled in terms of concentration and/or spatiotemporal localization.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our experimental procedure is based on the desorption of atomic and molecular species when a solid is bombarded with energetic massive projectiles such as, for example, C60+ or Au4004+ . Their impact causes abundant emission of neutral and ionized atoms, molecules and molecular fragments. The desorbed ions are detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The experimental procedure is that of secondary ion mass spectrometry with two innovations: the massive nature of the projectile and the mode of bombardment which is in a sequence of individual massive cluster impacts each isolated in time and space. Multiple ions can be ejected from a single impact. Given the size of the projectile (<= 3 nm in diameter), the co-ejected ions must originate from molecules colocated within nanometric dimensions.<br /><br /><br /><br />The new capabilities for detecting, localizing and tracking small numbers of molecules (10-18 to 10-21 moles) are tested on surfaces, membranes, and nano-objects selected for their relevance in catalysis, microelectronics, environmental and biomedical research.",Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n233d0627

Our experiments are principally designed to identify and optimize unique nanoscale phenomena useful for solar energy conversion, as well as related opportunities at the intersection of nanophotonics and chemistry. We employ optical and electrical characterization techniques with high spatial and energy resolution to probe optical excitation and relaxation mechanisms in nanostructured metals and semiconductors.<br /><br /><br /><br />The current world record solar cell operates at 44.4% power conversion efficiency. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that much higher efficiency is theoretically possible. Indeed, technical challenges, rather than laws of nature, limit current solar power convertors from achieving the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of 95%. <br /><br /><br /><br />We seek to better understand how nanofabricated optoelectronic and plasmonic materials provide a route to achieve the maximum possible conversion efficiency with solid state and photoelectrochemical systems. We explore how nanostructuring materials enables systematic control of the thermodynamic parameters governing optical power conversion, enabling optimization that can shape, confine, and interconvert the energy and entropy of a radiation field. Additionally, the remarkable nanoscale tailorability of a variety of structural properties, such as electrochemical potential, can further enable novel photochemical systems with broad application beyond the scope solar energy conversion.<br /><br /><br /><br />We seek students who are interested to gain expertise in inorganic synthesis of nanocrystals with tunable electrochemical and optical structures, nanofabrication, and comprehensive characterization and modeling of optoelectronic structures.

Dorothy,Shippen,Professor,"We are taking biochemical, molecular genetic and cytological approaches to study the structure, function and maintenance of telomeres. Telomeres are higher order nucleoprotein complexes that cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and play essential roles in conferring genome stability and cell proliferation capacity. The protective cap of the telomere is comprised of specific telomere binding proteins that regulate the length of telomeric DNA tract and allow the cell distinguish the chromosome terminus from a double-strand break. Telomeric DNA is synthesized by the action of telomerase, an unusual reverse transcriptase that replenishes telomeric DNA lost as a consequence of replication by conventional DNA polymerases. We have developed the genetically tractable flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system for studying telomeres in higher eukaryotes. With its sequenced genome, abundant genetic and transgenic tools, and extraordinarily high tolerance to genome instability, Arabidopsis has proven to be an excellent model for investigating fundamental processes in telomere biology.

Deborah,Siegele,Associate Professor,"Phenotypes are observable characteristics of an organism that result from the expression of a particular genotype in a particular environment. Examples of phenotypic traits in microbes are motility, sporulation, ability to perform anaerobic respiration, and resistance/sensitivity to an antibiotic. <br /><br /><br /><br />Until recently, phenotypic information has been captured as free text descriptions in research papers. Ambiguities in natural language confound attempts to retrieve information across sources. For example, ""serotype"" and ""serovar"" both refer to the same phenotype, but a simple text-based query with either word alone would miss the other. Or a single term, such as ""sporulation"" is used to refer to multiple, distinct processes in different organisms. Issues such as these hamper the ability to integrate different phenotypic data sets for the same organism or to use phenotypic information in one organism to predict possible phenotypes in another organism. Ideally, phenotype information should be stored in a consistent, computable format for ease of data integration and mining. <br /><br /><br /><br />Controlled vocabularies are used to provide both consistent terminology and a structured data format for the capture of biological information. Ontologies are controlled vocabularies of defined terms with unique identifiers and precise relationships to each other. There are phenotype ontologies available for many eukaryotic organisms, including fungi. However, when the OMP project was initiated, none of the existing ontologies was appropriate to comprehensively capture phenotypes for Bacteria or Archaea or to enable comparisons across microbial taxa.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Siegele lab and our collaborators at TAMU and the Univ. of Maryland (IGS) are developing a formal Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP). Our lab is focused on term development and annotating microbial phenotypes. OMP can be accessed at microbialphenotypes.org.

Daniel,Singleton,Professor,"The central focus of the Singleton research group is the study of organic, organometallic, and bioorganic reaction mechanisms, and the key tool that we use in these studies is the determination o kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). In the mid-1990's, we developed a method for the high precision combinatorial determination of small KIEs at natural abundance by NMR. Its direct applicability to complex unlabeled reactants makes this methodology 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than studies requiring labeling.

Broad training in the molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry of prokaryotic systems is employed to answer research-related questions.  Long-term interests in the lab are centered on understanding how B. burgdorferi promotes its pathogenic potential and persists in the disparate hosts it occupies in nature (e.g., both ticks and mammals).  In this regard, the research program is aligned with: (i) regulatory pathways that contribute to the establishment of infection during the arthropod to mammalian transition; (ii) characterizing the response to oxidative stressors in B. burgdorferi and the regulation thereof; (iii) identifying and characterizing surface structures that contribute to the colonization and maintenance of infection via adherence mechanisms; and (iv) the ability of B. burgdorferi and relapsing fever Borrelia to persistently infect hosts in the face of a potent innate and adaptive immune response.",Professor and Associate Head,Microbial Pathogenesis and Immunology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n638ae603

Impairments in synaptic pruning are observed in autism spectrum disorders and may contribute to symptoms such as sensory hypersensitivity and social overstimulation. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse also alters synapses in brain reward regions, and addiction-related synaptic and behavioral changes, similar to learning and memory, require the synthesis, or translation, of proteins in their local vicinity. Together these findings suggest that addiction is promoted and sustained through the coercion of normal plasticity mechanisms.

For the last 10 years, my work has focused on ischemic stroke, specifically, to understand how the aging brain copes with stroke. In North America, stroke risk increases with age and in this aging demographic, women are more likely to sustain a stroke and more likely to have long term disability, poor quality of life and have more neuropsychiatric problems after stroke such as depression and cognitive impairment. This problem is compounded by the fact that few stroke therapies are available. Most stroke neuroprotectants have not been successfully translated from the bench to bedside. Using preclinical models, we have focused on acute pathological changes at the blood brain barrier and central and peripheral inflammation as well as long-term consequences, such as changes to reward pathways and post-stroke depression and dementia. I am also interested in developing novel stroke therapies for stroke in this population and our studies on epigenetic modifications such as histone methylation and non-coding (mi)RNA due to aging/stroke have provided several candidate molecules. Our recent work focuses on the role of the gut microbiome and gut metabolites on stroke recovery, and its potential for understanding the pathophysiology of stroke. <br /><br />Related to my research goals, I am actively interested in promoting the inclusion of sex as a biological variable and attention to sex differences in medicine.

Joerg,Steiner,Professor,"My veterinary career has mainly focused on two aspects, patient care and clinically-relevant research. As a veterinary clinician and clinical teacher I am exposed to a wide variety of canine and feline patients with complex medical conditions. These patients serve as a constant source of new clinical problems that beckon to be studied further. Sometimes these studies are merely clinical, relating to characterization of an uncommon condition, diagnosis of a difficult-to-diagnose condition, or a novel therapeutic approach to a well-described condition. In other instances studies that are spurred by clinical cases are more basic-science based, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies to further evaluate the etiology or pathogenesis of a disease. In some instances, studies may provide comparative aspects related to experimental animals, such as rodents or primates, or even to human patients with similar conditions. I believe that my role as a mentor can be unique in that I can help graduate students bridge the gap between science and clinical aspects and between veterinary and human medical interests - giving us further opportunities to advance the concept of one-health.","Professor||Director, Gastrointestinal Laboratory",College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences||Small Animal Clinical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf4de66a0

Her research focus is on the cell biology of whole embryonic tissues, including cornea, cartilage, palate. Her lab has been funded from NIH, March of Dimes, Foundations and Private Companies for 3 decades. As a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, she carried out cell and molecular biology experiments on developing systems and worked with Dr. Elizabeth Hay when she developed her theories on cell-matrix interactions. As PI or co-Investigator on many previous university- and March of Dimes funded grants (over 30 years of continuous funding), she worked on how cell-matrix interactions change during development.  In addition, she was a mentor on two training grants (T32 and KL2) and has successfully administered other NIH supported developmental and cell biology projects (e.g. staffing, research protections, and budget), collaborated with other researchers, and produced peer-reviewed publications from each project. <br /><br /><br /><br /> She has a new project that contributes evidence to the theory that periocular mesenchyme (POM) cells contribute to the development of the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork and the iridocorneal angle.  The objective of this project is to determine if Gli1 positive cells contribute to the POM and anterior eye structures by using inducible Gli1-CreERT2; tdTomatoflox (Gli1-tdTomato) mouse model.  Experiments were recently completed that demonstrated the Gli1 + cells were also positive for Pitx2, FOXC1, and FOXC2, known markers for periocular mesenchyme during anterior eye development.  <br /><br /><br /><br />She has successfully trained 40 Postdoctoral, Ph.D., M.S. graduate students, undergraduate, medical and dental predoctoral students, and college/high school summer research trainees.","Assistant Dean||Regents Professor, Associate Department Head, Director of Oral Biology Graduate Program",College of Dentistry||Biomedical Sciences,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf7d937ba

One of the targets of his vaccine research is  brucellosis, a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by certain members of the genus Brucella.  Brucellosis is a great concern to public health in developing countries due to widespread prevalence of Brucella infections in livestock.  In the US, reservoirs of Brucella infections in wildlife, such as bison, elk, and feral swine, continue to pose a threat to livestock industries and human health.  The currently available brucellosis veterinary vaccines are neither efficacious in wild animals nor safe for human use.  Dr. Vemulapalli has developed novel recombinant vaccine strains that showed dramatically enhanced vaccine efficacy against brucellosis in murine models.  Testing these vaccines in domestic and wild animals is a goal of his research program.  Research projects in his laboratory are aimed at 1) understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella species, 2) developing attenuated Brucella strains as vectors to deliver protective proteins of other pathogens and tumors, 3) developing recombinant subunit vaccines to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and 4) development of molecular diagnostics assays for infectious disease investigations.",Professor and Head,Veterinary Pathobiology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n5889f585

Wayne,Versaw,Professor,"Compartmentalization of metabolic pathways and other cellular functions is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. This feature is extreme in plants due to the presence of organelles not found in most other eukaryotes - plastids. Plastids are a diverse group of interrelated organelles that perform a wide range of metabolic functions including photosynthesis, nitrogen and sulfur assimilation and the synthesis of amino acids, starch and fatty acids. These functions are coordinated with metabolic processes in the cytosol through dynamic exchange of metabolites and ions across the plastid inner envelope membrane.<br /><br /><br /><br />My lab is studying phosphate (Pi) transport processes that link the metabolic pathways in the plastid and cytosol. The concentrations of Pi in the cytosol and plastid stroma influence photosynthesis and the partitioning and storage of fixed carbon. Transporters involved in the movement of Pi across the plastid inner membrane include members of the pPT, PHT2 and PHT4 families. We are using genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and molecular physiology to investigate the function and physiological roles of these transporters. Recent findings suggest that some members of the PHT4 family are targeted to chloroplasts, whereas others function in heterotrophic plastids and one resides in the Golgi apparatus.<br /><br /><br /><br />Other projects in the lab include the genetic and biochemical characterization of Pi transport processes in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Mutants with altered phosphate uptake properties have been isolated, and these have led to the identification of Pi transporter genes, as well as genes with putative regulatory functions.",Professor,Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nea6b0d01

Coran,Watanabe,Associate Professor,"Our research group is actively characterizing the biosynthetic genes of this pathway, which involves a variety of techniques and strategies including: cloning and overexpression of genes, disruption/knockout of genes, enzymology, as well as chemical synthesis/isotopic labeling studies. Functional characterization of the genes of the pathway will not only shed light on the mechanism of azabicycle formation but will also pave the way for genetic engineering of the pathway and the development of new therapeutic methodologies.<br /><br /><br /><br />We have also been investigating the biosynthesis and cellular effects of cycloterpenals and their derivatives. Cycloretinal (all-trans retinal dimer), a representative member of this family of natural products is attributed to causing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in adults over the age of 50 that can lead to the loss of central vision. One of the most common early characteristic features of AMD (the dry form) is the accumulation of yellow deposits in the eye called drusen. A more severe form of the disease, the wet form, is characterized by neovascularization (abnormal blood vessel formation).  Our research group aims to study the role of beta-lactoglobulin in cycloretinal synthesis in the eye as an environmental (dietary), non-genetic contributor of AMD. This involves tracking BLG in the eye, monitoring the formation of cycloretinal, and elucidating the mechanism of cycloretinal formation.

One area of study is the structure and function of the superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that includes nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin 5HT3, glycine, and GABAA receptors. Members of this superfamily are involved in drug addiction and alcoholism, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, genetic forms of epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. We are developing new approaches to elucidating the molecular structures of these ion channels from animals and bacteria. Cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) are a second area of study. We are interpreting their electrophysiological properties in terms of structure and thermodynamics. Hearing is a third area of study. We are using computational models of calcium and potassium ion channels and mechanotransduction to explain electrophysiological function of cochlear hair cells. Fourth, analysis of genomes and tissue-specific transcriptomes of electrogenic animals (e.g., electric fish) is expected reveal new aspects of lifecycles of ion channels. Explaining neurological diseases in terms of protein structure is a theme linking our neuroscience research with neuropathology, my medical specialty.",Associate Professor,Molecular and Cellular Medicine,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nb25f91ff

Cynthia,Werner,Professor and Head,"Social Networks, Gifts, and Bribes<br /><br />I conducted 24 months of fieldwork in a rural region of southern Kazakhstan during the initial post-Soviet transition. I argue that rural households coped with market dynamics by maintaining strong household networks through regular exchanges of gifts and labor, and that these networks should be regarded as a key aspect of their household survival strategy. I also describe the ubiquity of ""gifts"" and ""bribes"" in Kazakhstan, and argued that some ""gifts"" function in part as ""bribes.""  <br /><br />Women in Central Asia<br /><br />In addition to writing about the lives of rural merchant women, I have written about bride kidnapping, one of the ""hot"" gender topics for this region. I argue that this practice increased in frequency after the fall of the Soviet Union (with the rise of nationalism, corruption, and economic disruption). I also argue how discourses of shame and tradition play a role in perpetuating non-consensual bride kidnapping. <br /><br />Nuclear Testing, Radiation Victims, and Radioactive Waste<br /><br />This research project includes interviews with three groups: rural residents living near the site, medical doctors, and nuclear scientists at Kazakhstan's National Nuclear Center. We argue that these groups have very different understandings of radiation's impact on human health.  Our research also looks at how memories and narratives of nuclear testing have been shaped by the politics of aid and nation-building projects in the present. <br /><br />Kazakhstan's Repatriation Program<br /><br />Since the early 1990s, nearly half of Mongolia's Kazakh population has migrated to Kazakhstan through a government repatriation program. We argue that women are more likely than men to experience significant geographical separations from kin due to cultural preferences for exogamy and patrilocal residence. We also argue that citizenship policies for repatriated Kazakhs have shifted over time, reflecting an inherent tension between neo-liberal and nation-building projects.",Professor and Head,Anthropology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc3cd48e6

Mary,Wicksten,Professor,"I am studying the Thoridae, a family of small-sized marine shrimp that are remarkably diverse in the cold waters of the North Pacific. Evidence suggests that these shrimp may be losing range due to global warming. They may be replaced by members of a different family, the Palaemonidae, a group of more aggressive predatory shrimp. But to study such a replacement, one must identify the shrimp. The last major study was in 1906. All previous work has been morphological. Evidence from my own work and that of Greg Jensen, University of Washington, suggests that not only have species been confused (one species is actually two, three species actually are only one) but the generic designation may depend on temperature-dependent features. With a small start-up grant from the Arctic Biodiversity Study, I am collaborating with Luis Hurtado,, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Science, to obtain some molecular data on genetic affinities within the Thoridae and potentially allied shrimp taxa. These data may at least indicate which of the supposed genera are distinct or even if the Thoridae is indeed a natural group.

In pursuit of this goal, she has investigated how individuals use language to form collective identities with and against others, how leaders use narratives to mobilize those collectivities for action, and how processes of dialogue and deliberation can build bridges between oppositional stakeholders to facilitate the achievement of deeper shared understandings and more democratic public decisions. Her work has been published in journals such as Journal of Communication, Management Communication Quarterly, and Journal of Applied Communication Research. Her co-authored book, Sex and Stigma: Stories of Everyday Life in Nevada's Legal Brothels received the 2019 Book of the Year Award from the Critical Cultural Studies Division of the National Communication Association; Outstanding Book Award from the Organization for the Study of Communication, Language, and Gender; and Honorable Mention for the Sarah A. Whaley Book Prize from the National Women's Studies Association. She is also a member of the planning team for the Aspen Conference, a community of engaged organizational communication scholars focused on developing practical theory and collaborative research that bridge academic-practitioner interests. Consistent with the commitments of engaged organizational communication research, much of Dr. Wolfe's current work is conducted in collaboration with community partners, especially local governments, to use communication theory in the service of addressing everyday problems of living in a pluralistic society.",Associate Professor,Communication,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n4b98e766

The uniqueness represents in its capabilities of dramatical acceleration of organic reactions and the driving of reactions that cannot occur in bulk. We aim to develop microdroplet reactors for acceleration, explore new reactivity, and study fundamentals of microdroplet acceleration. iv) reaction mechanistic study: reaction mechanisms play an essential role in the study of organic chemistry. We aim to develop new online mass spectrometric reaction monitoring system to explore unknown reaction mechanism, capture short-lived intermediates, study kinetics of fast reactions, and control process of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis.

Our research utilizes a variety of unique in vivo and in vitro models, including transgenic and humanized mice. An underlying theme of our research is the discovery of bio-physiological determinants of disparities in breast cancer incidence and outcome. Another project focuses on the interdependent regulation of ER and p53, and the role of racially disproportionate p53 polymorphisms in mediating breast cancer development and progression. A new project in the laboratory project is focused on investigating the impact of exposure to metabolic syndrome during different stages of development on metabolic function and mammary cancer risk. This line of research was initiated, in part, due to the obesity epidemic in the US, and the increasing prevalence of obesity in younger children.

Ryland,Young,Professor,"Most bacterial viruses (phages) cause lysis of their host cell to release the progeny virions. Large phages elaborate an enzyme (""endolysin"") to degrade the cell wall and also a small membrane protein (""holin""). The holin accumulates in the membrane and then, at a precisely scheduled time, suddenly forms a hole to allow release of endolysin through the cytoplasmic membrane to gain access to the wall. We use molecular genetics and biochemistry to study how this small protein is able to act as a molecular ""clock"" and punch holes in membranes. Small phages make single proteins which cause host lysis in a different way. This strategy is to target the host cell wall synthesis machinery; that is, the virus makes a ""protein antibiotic"" that causes lysis in the same way as antibiotics like penicillin by inhibiting an enzyme in the multi-step pathway of murein biosynthesis. Thus, when the infected cell tries to divide, it blows up, or lyses, because it can't make the new cell wall between the daughter cells. Remarkably, each of three different, small phages blocks a different step in the pathway. These small lysis proteins are models for a completely new class of antibacterial antibiotics. Also, the E. coli SlyD protein is required for this mode of lysis in one case. SlyD is a member of an ubiquitous family of proteins related to human ""immunophilins,"" the targets of immune-suppression drugs. We study SlyD to learn about the role of this class of proteins in biology.",Professor,Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nea775348

These mechanisms include cell-cell recognition and target-dependent induction of the presynaptic secretion machinery. Some of our studies investigate synapse formation of identified motoneurons of the American pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis , following nerve injury in vivo and in cell culture. Since the synapse is the site of most interneuronal communication within the nervous system, an understanding of the development, regeneration and plasticity of these connections is crucial to an ultimate appreciation of neural integration and brain function.<br /><br /><br /><br />Neural Morphallaxis<br /><br />We also study a rare form of regeneration called neural morphallaxis in the annelid worm, Lumbriculus variegatus. This organism is ideal for examining behavioral, physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms of development, regeneration and systems-level plasticity. We have defined the neural correlates of escape reflexes, which are reconfigured during morphallaxis. Recently we have begun investigations of synaptic molecules up-regulated specifically during morphallaxis.

Darryl,de Ruiter,Professor,"I am a paleoanthropologist whose research focuses on the ecology and evolution of the early hominins of Africa. My research centers on the origin of the genus Homo, and on early representatives of that genus. In 2010, my research team and I announced the discovery of a new hominin species - Australopithecus sediba - from the site of Malapa in South Africa. Australopithecus sediba represents a curious mixture of both australopith-like and Homo-like morphologies, and based on this mosaic of characters, we hypothesized that it represents the australopith ancestor of the genus Homo. In 2015 my research team and I announced the discovery of another new hominin species - Homo naledi - from the site of Rising Star, also in South Africa. This species is especially fascinating in that it was likely contemporaneous with the earliest representatives of Homo sapiens, and, perhaps even more remarkable, that they appear to have deliberately disposed of their dead. I am also involved in a series of studies investigating the isotope ecology of modern South Africa in order to better contextualize the isotope ecology of the extinct hominins of South Africa. <br /><br /><br /><br />I originally arrived at Texas A&M University in 2003, after receiving my PhD in Anatomical Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in 2001.
